## About Me

Computer Science undergraduate at **Iowa State University** with a strong focus on **software engineering, AI systems, and backend development**. I enjoy working close to the system level - **performance, correctness, automation, and scalability** - and I’m especially interested in how modern **LLMs and AI tooling** integrate with real production systems.

I’ve worked across **research, backend engineering, and infrastructure**, owning projects from **design → implementation → deployment**.

**Core interests:**
- Backend & API design
- AI systems & LLM evaluation
- Distributed systems & automation
- Clean architecture and performance focused code
